## Guideline for students

Create your own fork by using the **Fork** button. 
This will create your own private repo that you can edit at your heart's content. 
You will still need to checkout the repo into a working clone in your machine(s), and then commit changes from the working clone back to your private fork.

Before starting any work of your own, **Sync fork** from the main repository to your private repo.
And **Sync fork** again before asking for a *pull request*, to make sure there are no conflicts.
When you are ready to move your contribution ot the main repository, click the **Contribute** button and ask for a *pull request*.
