## Guideline for students

Create your own fork by using the **Fork** button. 
In the **Create a new fork** page, choose yourself as the owner (`<owner>`) and a repository name (`<project>`).
You also want to check the box that says **Copy the main branch only** and click on the **Create fork** button.
This will create your own private repo that you can edit at your heart's content. 
You will still need to checkout the repo into a working clone in your machine(s), and then commit changes from the working clone back to your private fork.
You can create the working clone with

>  git clone git@github.com:<owner>/<project>.git

Before starting any work of your own, **Sync fork** from the main repository to your private repo.
And **Sync fork** again before asking for a *pull request*, to make sure there are no conflicts.
When you are ready to move your contribution to the main repository, click the **Contribute** button and ask for a *pull request*.

Keep situational awareness! 
You should never make changes to the main repository.
(If the configurations are right, you should not be able to.)
But your private repo is yours!
You can do anything you want, including deleting it and making a fresh fork.
